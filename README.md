# Steppen Code Challenges

Our code challenges for developers considering joining the team, so we understand better where you are in skill level.

## Overall Guidelines

- These tasks aim to give us an indication of what you can and can’t do.
- Please make your code as clean as you can, because otherwise we’re going to assume that you’re always messy. When working we don’t always have time to write clean code, and this is often fine, but in this process we need to know what “clean code” means to you.
- Comments aren’t required, good code should mostly be self-documenting in its variable and function names. But feel free to comment anywhere where you have something to communicate to us.
- Specifically, for more complex tasks, you might want to communicate:
    - Any assumptions you’ve made about the user or other context which affected your solution.
    - Your design/architectural approach.
    - Any considerations or tradeoffs that might be important to consider if this code was going to production.
- Be specific about the language/framework version your code is written for. Ideally this should be reasonably modern. For example, JavaScript should be ES6, using common modern features like async/await and arrow functions. However, if you’re not comfortable/experienced with a particular modern variant, use what you are comfortable with, and just specify that.
- It’s not necessary to write and submit tests for this code. However, if you’re more comfortable with test-driven development then feel free to do so.
- If the task has UI then please make that look good to the best of your ability. You’re not being hired as a designer, but in practice there are often times that developers have to tweak designs to improve them, so generally it’s good if you feel comfortable coming up with something.

## Way of Working

- Fork this repo on GitHub.
- Check the individual directories for each task you're doing for specific instructions.
- Once finished, point us to your fork and tell us which challenges you're submitting.
